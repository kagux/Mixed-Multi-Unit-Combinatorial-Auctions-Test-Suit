Compiled version is "/out/artifacts/MMUCA_jar/MMUCA.jar". You need Java Runtime Environment 1.6 to run the application.
To compile you need the following jars:
1.jung 2.01
2.miglayout
3.mockito (for tests)
4.junit 4.8(for tests)
5.jgoodies

Side notes:
Domain is developed using TDD approach, you can find corresponding tests in "/tests/". UI part is done without tests, uses MVC architecture (need some help with that part)
